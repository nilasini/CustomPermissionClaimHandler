# CustomPermissionClaimHandler
With this custom claim handler, we can get custom permissions along with the id token.

Note:- In order to retrive application's role's permission through id token, you have to enable the property GetAllRolesOfUserEnabled in user-mgt.xml file. By default it is disabled.
	            
1. Stop the server if it is already running.

2. Build the project and copy the JAR file org.wso2.permission.claim.handler-1.0.jar to the <IS_HOME>/repository/components/dropins directory.

3. If you are using IS version below IS-5.9.0 then change the <ClaimHandler> property of application-authentication.xml file located inside <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/identity directory, with the custom hanlder's fully qualified name (for this example org.wso2.custom.claim.PermissionClaimHandler).
   
   If you are using IS version higher or equal to IS-5.9.0 then please add the following config to deployment.toml file
   
   ```
   [authentication.framework.extensions] 
   claim_handler="org.wso2.custom.claim.PermissionClaimHandler" 
   ```

4. Check the above Note and Start the server

5. Create new Local Claim to represent permissions (In this sample I have created a local claim with claim uri http://wso2.org/claims/permission) (If you are using diffrent claim uri then you have to change the value of the constant PERMISSION_CLAIM in the code).

6. Create an External Claim with http://wso2.org/oidc/claim as Dialect URI and for the Mapped Local Claim select the local claim created in step 5. For this sample it will be http://wso2.org/claims/permission. (Let's say my External Claim URI is permission)

7. Add the created claim http://wso2.org/claims/permission to Requested Claims of Service provider (Option available in Claim Configuration tab in service provider section).

8. Add the name of the external claim (My case it is permission) to the OIDC config file located in the registry "/_system/config/oidc". You have to add the claim under the scope "openid".

Sample request for implicit grant with response type id token would be:- 

https://localhost:9443/oauth2/authorize?response_type=id_token&client_id=<client_id>&scope=openid&redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>&nonce=<random_value>

Parse the retrieved id token then sample JSON would be as follows :- 

{
  "sub": "nilasini",
  "aud": [
    "LpCaE3Tyhf_ksaXJ7Pvq_Ke6gjca"
  ],
  "role": [
    "Internal/everyone",
    "login",
    "customRole"
  ],
  "azp": "LpCaE3Tyhf_ksaXJ7Pvq_Ke6gjca",
  "iss": "https://localhost:9443/oauth2/token",
  "permission": [
    "/permission/admin/login",
    " /permission/applications/playground2.com/mycustomclaim"
  ],
  "exp": 1532214545,
  "nonce": "qwdqdq",
  "iat": 1532210945
}
